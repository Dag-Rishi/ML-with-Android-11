This repository demonstrates how you can get started with on-device ML with 
tools or plugins specifically launched with 
[Android 11](https://developer.android.com/11). If you have earlier worked with 
ML in Android, you will explore easier ways to integrate your ML applications 
with your Android apps. In this repository I majorly demonstrate the two 
biggest updates: 
[ML Model Binding Plugin](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2020/06/tools-for-custom-ML-models.html)
and the [new ML Kit](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2020/06/tools-for-custom-ML-models.html)
.
